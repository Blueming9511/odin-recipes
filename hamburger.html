        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
                <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
                <li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
                <li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
                <li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
                <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2><u>Step</u></h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</li>
            <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties</li>
            <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</li>
